            <!-- Description of UX roles -->
            <p>UX roles describe the various parts designers play in the design process. They range from generalist roles—e.g., UX designers and product designers—to specialist ones such as visual designers and UX researchers. UX roles might overlap in scope, and they keep evolving with our understanding of the ideal design process.</p>

            <!-- Description of how design teams follow a user-centered design process -->
            <p>One major part of what a design team does is to follow a user-centered design process and work through it to produce the best possible designs for the target users. Teammates perform many tasks throughout projects—from user research, to prototyping, to conducting usability testing—to iterate towards optimal solutions. Design thinking showcases the key UX tasks corresponding to these roles. It also reflects how each role contributes slightly differently regarding tasks. Main roles are:</p>

        <!-- Final thoughts on UX role definitions -->
        <p>Organizations’ definitions of UX roles vary. While these shouldn’t deviate drastically from those listed above, you should research a brand’s culture to understand its expectations. For instance, recruiters scanning UX portfolios may want a “UX designer” to handle all UX-related tasks. Applicants would then address that in their UX cover letters and UX resumes. Also, with the industry’s dynamic nature, expect to constantly find new job titles, job descriptions and UX tools. Nonetheless, your knowledge remains timeless – you just must adapt to whatever hat your company wants you to wear.</p>
